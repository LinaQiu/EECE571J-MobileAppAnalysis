Here are two ways to build FlowDroid:
1. Build from source
2. Using the nightly build version

Each way corresponds to one folder. Here are instructions for each way:

1. Build from source
dependencies you need:
Jasmin: https://github.com/Sable/jasmin
Heros: https://github.com/Sable/heros
Soot: https://github.com/Sable/soot
soot-infoflow: https://github.com/secure-software-engineering/soot-infoflow
soot-infoflow-android: https://github.com/secure-software-engineering/soot-infoflow-android

import all five projects(Jasmin, Heros, Soot, soot-infoflow, soot-infoflow-android) into Eclipse. 
If meet errors, go to Preferences->Java->Compiler->Complier compliance level, change it to the highest one (for example, 1.8)



2. Use the nightly build version
Put all jar files together in the same folder, done.
